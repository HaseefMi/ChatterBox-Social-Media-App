# ChatterBox-Social-Media-App

--- Description ---
Simple Social Media App that allows users to create and sign in to accounts via email or google. Users can post and like other posts. 

--- Context ---
I had just finished my Professional Certificate in Front End Development from Meta and I was pursuing Senior React Certification from Udemy. I had no Back End knowledge yet so I used a no SQL database soloution (Google Firebase). This was the first project I have ever built on my own outside of course work

--- Technologies Used ---
React.js, Firestore

--- Challenges Faced ---
This was the first time I had ever built an entire project on my own. It was a very new and unfamiliar experience to me having to build an entire Web application from scratch without any professional help, guidance or tutorial which I was accustomed to while learning web development. Additionaly, this was my first time ever working with Google Firestore. At first it felt a bit overwhelming to figure out exactly how to use this. I had to read a lot of documentation (And consulted with ChatGPT -_-), but eventually I had the sufficent knowledge to be able to succsesufuly intergrate this into my project.

I hope you find this interesting. I'm still a relativley new Software Developer & looking for experience. If you feel like I may be of use to you, please don't hesitate to reach out to me!
